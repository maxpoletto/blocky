The "Blocky" Chrome extension does not collect any user data nor share it with anyone, and it never will.
I wrote it because I couldn't find an extension that had the features I wanted and that didn't grant
itself more permissions than necessary.

Blocky:
- stores your block configuration (what sites to block and at what times) in your Chrome's local storage;
- uses Chrome's "declarativeNetRequest" API to tell Chrome what patterns should be blocked;
- does not itself have access to the URLs that you browse;
- does not talk to any external sites or services.

It will stay that way.
